# ContinuationCam
ContinuationCam aims to be a simple Swift package that allows computer vision tasks and to alleviate the boilerplate coming from AVFoundation.
It provides a camera module that uses an ```@escaping (CIImage) -> ()``` closure to feed the preview image stream into your computer vision tasks.
